# Fake News Detector

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to detect fake news by scraping and analyzing website data, including domain name extensions, HTML structure, and the text content of articles. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as Bag of Words and word vectors, the model classifies news articles as real or fake.

The dataset used for this project consisted of 500,000 labeled articles. The system achieved an impressive 96% test accuracy in identifying fake news, highlighting its effectiveness in distinguishing between reliable and unreliable sources.
